The problem:
============
You'll find that the typed input is not very accurate as "test" input because Alexa converts what you 
say to text that may be a bit different than what you expect. For example: acronyms like HTTP may 
be translated to h. t. t. p. once converted from your voice input. 

So the best way to test is with audio.
The Alexa skill testing page lets you create audio of something that's typed out. So why not use that as
a test for your skill!? But how? 

The solution:
=============
Record a bunch of Alexa's spoken audio of what you type in... Use Alexa to test Alexa!
Type what phrase you want to test and if you go into Inspect mode of the browser by right clicking on the
browser page and selecting "Inspect" you can tailor the Inspect mode to look for "media" type data.

You may need to do some adjusting of the browser window to get the split area adjusted to where you 
can see what URLs are being loaded.

Once you see the links to the audio that was just created as a result of playing your phrase throught the
voice simulator, just right click the link (a big string of random letters and numbers) and pick 
"Copy" and pick sub item "Copy Response". That will give you a really long data URL. Paste that URL
into a browser window and it will play the audio contained! Better still, you now get a download 
arrow (if in Chrome) and you can download the audio to your computer for playback later.

The problem that results from the solution to the first problem:
================================================================
Windows is lame and doesn't know how to play that type of MP3 file even though Chrome does. (stupid huh?)
So now you have a bunch of totally useless MP3 files that won't play.

The solution to the problem that results from the solution to the first problem:
================================================================================
Download the MP3 converter here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
Unzip the file to a directory you have rights to that preferably doesn't have spaces in the path name!!!

Add the directory to your path temporarily... If you installed it in a directory called C:\Utils\FFMPEG, then
you could add it to your path with something like:

c:\> path=%path% + c:\Utils\FFMPEG\bin\;

The path command will add it to your path only temporarily and the next time you reboot it will be gone again.
I do that because I don't like to have a lot of extra crap in my path variable when it's not needed regularly.
Or, if you don't mind a messier command line you can use the entire path to the ffmpeg program 
like: c:\Utils\FFMPEG\bin\ffmpeg

Here's the DOS (Windows) version of the command to convert all the *.mp3 files in a directory to out*.mp3
=====

for %f in (*.mp3) do ( ffmpeg -y -i "%~nf.mp3" -ar 16000 -ab 48k -codec:a libmp3lame -ac 1 "out%~nf.mp3")

=====
Once converted over you can play back the audio as tests by clicking them. Of course, the audio to invoke
the skill name and then the audio of whatever phrases you want to test.

You can even use them in a Power-Point or automate the playing of them in whatever way makes you feel like a boss.
